    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>February 24, 1955</strong>Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and
        Abdulfattah Jandali. The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs'
        non-biological parents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1961</strong>The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as
        Silicon Valley.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1968</strong>Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for
        spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the
        company that summer.


      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1970</strong>Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006
        autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1972</strong>Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in
        Portland, Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him,
        such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1974</strong>Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak
        to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that
        would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to
        California to live in a commune.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1976</strong>Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells
        the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
        season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
        strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
        mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
      </li>
      <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
        increase their maize and sorghum yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
        University
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
        supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
        we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
        are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
        plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
        people were selecting the best breeds."
      </li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
