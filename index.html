    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>February 24, 1955</strong>Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and
        Abdulfattah Jandali. The then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs'
        non-biological parents.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1961</strong>The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as
        Silicon Valley.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1968</strong>Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for
        spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the
        company that summer.


      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1970</strong>Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006
        autobiography, "iWoz," he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1972</strong>Graduates from Homestead High School in Cupertino, Calif., and enrolls at Reed College in
        Portland, Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested him,
        such as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1974</strong>Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak
        to help whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game that
        would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to return to
        California to live in a commune.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1976</strong>Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells
        the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>January 3, 1977</strong>Apple incorporates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>June 5, 1977</strong>Releases the Apple II, the first commercially available personal computer in a
        plastic case with color graphics--and Apple's first successful personal computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>December 12, 1980</strong>Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>January 24, 1984</strong>Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl
        commercial airs, introduces the Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first
        time ever, I'd like to let Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer
        you can't lift." Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a graphical user
        interface.
      </li>
      <li><strong>September 12, 1985</strong>CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple
        chairman, saying in a board meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life.
        It's obvious that I've got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which
        later becomes NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT
        workstation, sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server of
        the World Wide Web.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1995</strong>Becomes Pixar's president and CEO. Later in the year, Jobs brings Pixar public, one week
        after the release of "Toy Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear. The
        film earns $192 million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for celebrities to lend
        their voices to animated characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2001</strong>Introduces the iPod:
        "With iPod, Apple has invented a whole new category of digital music player that lets you put your entire music
        collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go...With iPod, listening to music will never be the
        same again." Apple's shipped more than 300 million iPods as of October 2011.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2007</strong>
        Drops "Computer" from Apple's name. Introduces the iPhone: "iPhone is a revolutionary and magical product that
        is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone...We are all born with the ultimate pointing device--our
        fingers--and iPhone uses them to create the most revolutionary user interface since the mouse." Apple owns 19.1
        percent of the smartphone market as of August 2011, having shipped 108 million iPhones worldwide as of March
        2011.
      </li>
      <li><strong>October 5, 2011</strong> - dies at the age of 56.</li>
